# Devrary

> A Virtual Knowledge Library for Software Engineering  
> Structured. Accessible. Free.

---

## Overview

Devrary is an interactive virtual library that organizes software engineering knowledge using a real-world library structure.

Instead of endless scrolling and scattered resources, Devrary allows users to explore learning content spatially:

- **Room → Domain** (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, AI/ML)
- **Shelf → Programming Language / Technology**
- **Book → Concept**
- **Pages → Curated Learning Resources**

The goal is to reduce cognitive overload and make learning structured, intuitive, and accessible.
